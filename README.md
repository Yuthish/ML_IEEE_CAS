Repo for ML sessions

## About
This Repo contains all the resources and all the work done during the sessions.

## Introduction
*Machine Learning* is widely used these days and is improving each and every day. People are doing huge amount of research to make machines more accurate and intelligent.
It has huge amount of applications and is widely adapted in many places.

## Applications
Some of the major applications are
   * Speech Recognition
   * OCR
   * Predictive search results
   * Recommendation Systems
   * Self driving cars
   * Chatbots
   * Image Processing

## Tools 
These tools are recommended for creating Machine Learning Models
   * [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb#recent=true)
